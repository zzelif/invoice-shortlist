## Thought Process & Prioritization

1. **Core CRUD**: Focused on building a solid create-read-update foundation (form â†’ list â†’ update status).
2. **Authentication**: Secured routes early to avoid rework.
3. **Filtering**: Added status filter via URL paramsâ€”spent extra time understanding async `searchParams` in Next.js 15.
4. **Styling & Responsiveness**: Polished UI to be mobile-friendly.

_Used a combination of a YouTube tutorial and ChatGPT to accelerate implementation while learning the new App Router APIs._

## Next Steps

If given more time, I would:

- Integrate Stripe Checkout for payments
- Generate downloadable invoice PDFs
- Add email notifications with Resend
- Implement invoice deletion & confirmations
- Build client management (CRUD for clients)
- Add dark mode & accessibility improvements

---

## Known Limitations & Bugs

- Tailwind CSS v4 introduced minor breaking changes (e.g., some pointer-events utilities)
- Change status value sync occasionally lags due to clientâ†’server round trip
- No pagination: table shows all invoices in one page.
